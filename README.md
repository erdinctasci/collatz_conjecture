# Collatz Conjecture Solver

This Python script implements an algorithm to solve the Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 problem, Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, or the Syracuse problem. It is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics that asserts any positive integer will eventually reach 1 when following a specific set of operations.

## Features

- Accepts any positive integer as input.
- Calculates the number of steps required to reach 1 according to the Collatz Conjecture.
- Handles invalid input gracefully, prompting the user to enter a valid integer.

## Getting Started

To run this script, you will need Python installed on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Download the `collatz_steps.py` file from this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded `collatz_steps.py`.
5. Run the script by typing `python collatz_steps.py` and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Usage

- When prompted, enter a positive integer for which you want to calculate the Collatz steps.
- The script will display the number of steps required to reach 1 according to the Collatz conjecture.
